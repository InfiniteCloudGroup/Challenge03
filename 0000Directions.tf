***THE CHALLENGE***... 

If you know even a little about coding, here is a fun challenge. 
Build your own 00-Auth  |  01-VPC  |  02-Subnets files FROM SCRATCH. 
No git, no peeking at previous projects. 

Build the subnets using a count loop. And put a public/private subnet in each of 3 AZ's using a count loop
Using a count loop launch an EC2 in each of the AZ's... 

This URL is all I used in addition to Terraform.io to make it happen. https://stackoverflow.com/.../terraform-create-ec2...
