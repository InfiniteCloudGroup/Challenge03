***THE CHALLENGE***... 

If you know even a little about coding, here is a fun challenge. 

a) Use variables when possible
b) Build your own 00-Auth  |  01-VPC  |  02-Subnets files FROM SCRATCH. No git, no peeking at previous projects. 
c) Using a count loop
      Build 3 public subnets, each in a different AZ
      Build 3 private subnets in those AZ's as well
      Deploy an EC2 in each public as well
          Name them based on the AZ they are deployed in

You may use Terraform.io
In addition, here is a Url to make it happen
